yode
====

*yode* could be an acronym for the following not-so-profound statement: "yodeling omnidirectionally disturbs everyone".  In this case, however, it isn't.  In truth, we don't really know what *yode* means.  What we do know about *yode* is that it is the beginnings of a fun application based on the `libuv` library (as is `Node.js`), that can interpret a nice language called [Yola](https://github.com/edadma/yola) (meaning Yode language).

*yode* is written in Scala Native.
